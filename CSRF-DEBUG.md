# Browser CSRF Debug Tool

This is a comprehensive CSRF debugging tool to help diagnose browser-specific CSRF issues. To use it:

1. Deploy the updated code with new debugging tools
2. Access https://jkleinlabs.com/csrf-debug.html
3. Use the debug page to:
   - Check if CSRF cookies are properly set
   - Verify request headers sent to the server
   - Test form submission with proper CSRF token handling

The tool will help identify why browser submissions fail while curl requests succeed.
